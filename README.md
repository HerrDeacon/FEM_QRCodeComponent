## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Not directly related to the challenge but took the opportunity to start learning about landmarks and accessibility, which are both very new concepts to me. 

### Continued development

Even though I use and write HTML/CSS every day at work, I have found that because of the nature of the projects I work on I've never had to really keep my skills up in this area. My skillset is now years old and its time to get with the times so I decided to change this and was happy to find Frontend Mentor to use as a great way to work my way through learning all the latest standards and features. Look forward to doing more challanges.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - This helped me find the correct parameters and syntax for a number of elements.
